# License and origin

This client is based very heavily on the work that Matt Robenolt and others did on the [raven-js client](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-js/) for Sentry. This started out as a fork of Raven and is now incompatible with Sentry, therefore it has been renamed to avoid confusing anyone. See LICENSE.md for more.
